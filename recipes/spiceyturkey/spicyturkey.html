 <li>While the turkey is cooling, lets go gather the last ingredient.
     Go to your nearest space sport, and travel to <strong>ARRAKIS</strong>
     and get some of that <em>Spice</em>. This is whay will provide with the best
     spicey aroma and taste for our turkey. We are gaming hard.

 <li>Before adding the spice, get the satanic bible; light up the room with the funny candles;
     and using the leftover blood inscribe the floor to contact Santa :)
 </li>

 <li>For the last step, place the turkey in the middle of the pentagram,
     Put the spice on top of it, start invoking satan and whilst doing so;
     do the <em>naenae</em>   and start <strong>dabbing very hard</strong>
     They turkey should start to ignite and explode. If your house is not on fire
     and a <strong>Demonic Bird Entity</strong> isn't in your vicinity, then you
     have failed as a gamer! Enjoy :D</li>
